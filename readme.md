# Blazor Mobile Bindings Demo
Demo project for my Blazor Mobile Bindings talks

This is a demo project that I use for my Blazor Mobile Bindings talks. The repository has three projects in the `src` folder:

- `HybridDemo`: The default hybrid app created by the hybrid blazor mobile bindings template
- `MbbConferenceDemo`: A simple Blazor Mobile Bindings app using shell, css, dependency injection and Xamarin.Essentials
- `MobileBlazorBindingsDemo`: The default mobile blazor bindings app created by the hybrid template

## What you need to build and run the source code

- .NET Core SDK 3.1
- VS 2019 (Windows or Mac) with Xamarin and ASP.NET Workloads
- Edge Canary (for the hybrid app on Windows)
- The blazor mobile bindings template. You can install the templates on your command line with the following command:

`dotnet new -i Microsoft.MobileBlazorBindings.Templates::0.4.74-preview`

## Do you need help with your own Xamarin apps?
